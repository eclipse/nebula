Version 2.0.0 (Milestone 0)
* API Changes:
  * Renamed bundle names as follows:
      net.sf.paperclips          => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips
      net.sf.paperclips.ui       => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips.widgets
      net.sf.paperclips.examples => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips.examples
      net.sf.paperclips.test     => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips.tests
  * Renamed public packages as follows:
      net.sf.paperclips          => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips
      net.sf.paperclips.ui       => org.eclipse.nebula.paperclips.widgets
  * Removed all classes and methods deprecated in previous releases.
  * Removed net.sf.paperclips.decorator classes

Version 1.0.4
* Bugs fixed:
  * [Mac OSX] Disposing a PrintPreview sends a blank page to the printer.
  * Autoscaled ScalePrints were not computing minimum sizes correctly
    which distorted some layouts
  * PaperClips and PrintPreview now use the first system printer listed if
    no system default printer has been selected (can be the case on Linux,
    Mac)
  * Fixed compiler compliance levels so PaperClips can run in Java 1.4 JREs.
  * GridColumn's conversion of inches, millimeters and centimeters sizes to
    points was wrong, causing those columns to be displayed at the wrong size.
  * Fixed GridColumn's recognition of column sizes with a decimal part.
* New Features:
  * Page numbers are internationalized in English, French and German.
  * TextStyle.create(String) creates a TextPrint
  * Added DebugPrint helper class for troubleshooting documents that won't
    print
* Known issues:
  * [Linux GTK] Printed text scales up or down depending on what DPI the
    screen is configured to
  * [Linux GTK] When a PrintPreview changes printers, print jobs, or is
    disposed, a blank page is emitted on the printer.  This is due to missing
    API in GTK for cancelling a print job.

Version 1.0.3
* Bugs fixed:
  * Fixed integer overflow error in GridPrint which sometimes caused printing
    of very long strings to fail.
  * Fixed column size distribution in GridPrint when paper space is scarce.
* New Features
  * PrintPreview now supports lazy layout of print jobs.  This can be used to
    speed up previews of very large print jobs. 
* Changes:
  * Implement equals() and hashCode() in all Print objects.
  * Performance tuning in text and grid layouts
  * Snippets no longer implement Print.  This was an unnecessary detail and
    tends to confuse newcomers.
* Known issues:
  * PrintPreview issues a page feed whenever a PrintPreview control is
    disposed or changes printers.  This is due to missing API in GTK for
    cancelling a print job.

Version 1.0.2
* Bugs fixed:
  * Clipping problems on Mac OS X.
  * PrintPreview.getPageCount() returns 0 before pages are first drawn.
  * PrintPreview spits out a blank page on Linux when the window is closed.
  * BorderPrint sometimes showed an open bottom border even though the target
    was completely shown.
  * PrintViewer performance improvements when print document is vertically
    greedy.
* New Features:
  * GridPrint.setCellClippingEnabled() controls whether grid cells may be
    broken across pages.  See GridPrintCellClippingExample.java.
  * DefaultGridLook.setCellPadding()
  * PrintPreview.setHorizontalPageCount() and setVerticalPageCount() controls
    how many pages are shown on screen.
  * Experimental PaperClips.setDebug() API helps troubleshoot documents that
    won't lay out properly ("Unable to layout on page x" errors).
  * BasicGridLookPainter simplifies implementing custom GridLooks.
  * StyledTextPrint for mixing text with different font sizes, styles, colors
    and decorations.  Other printable objects such as ImagePrint may be
    embedded inline with the text.
  * TextPrint and StyledTextPrint now support underline and strikeout text.
  * TextPrint.setWordSplitting() controls whether words may be split between
    rows.  This feature only applies when space is very limited.
  * Unified error reporting to PaperClips.error() methods.  Custom Print
    implementations should use these methods to act uniformly with the rest
    of the library. 
* Example snippets:
  * Changed ImageCaptureExample.java to capture JPG since PNG was not fully
    supported until SWT version 3.3 (PaperClips is developed against 3.2).
  * Snippet7 (print preview example):
    * Support scrolling with the mouse wheel (horizontally with Shift+Wheel)
    * Support zooming with Ctrl+Wheel

Version 1.0.1
* Resolved printing problems on Mac OS X.
* Added public accessor APIs for all Print classes.

Version 1.0.0
* Vertical cell alignment in GridPrint, including SWT.FILL alignment to allow
  embedding vertically greedy prints like SWT.VERTICAL LinePrints.
* SidewaysPrint - a non-greedy version of RotatePrint.  Very handy for putting
  sideways text in grids.
* TextPrint's and PageNumberPrint's horizontally greedy behavior had to be
  removed in order for SidewaysPrint to work correctly.  This will not cause
  any compilation problems, however you may see some unexpected layout
  behavior.
* Updated Snippet7 (print preview example) in examples plug-in to clean up some
  of the odd behavior when resizing the window in Fit-to-Width or Fit-to-Height
  mode.  Also added code for scrolling around the page using mouse drag.
* Bug fix: PaperClips.getPages() throws the wrong exception when a document
  fails to lay out properly.
* Bug fix: PrintPreview does not redraw when setScale is called to change the
  display scale.
* Bug fix: Headers/footers in a PagePrint do not display any contents after
  the page number.

Version 0.6.1
* PrintPreview control:
  * ComputeSize is now implemented properly, which helps determine the proper
    sizing of the control depending on the viewing scale.  Snippet7 has been
    updated to demonstrate this feature.
  * The performance problems (read: major lags) when zooming in very close are
    resolved.  Go ahead, zoom to ridiculous levels with confidence!  We
	  promise not to tell anyone.
  * Bugfix: page disappears after a call to setPrinterData.
* ColumnPrint behavior of compressing the last page of content to the minimum
  possible height can now be disabled using the "compressed" property.
* GridPrint now has addColumn and addColumns methods supporting column
  modifications after construction.  Some of the snippets were modified to use
  this new API.

Version 0.6.0
* JDK 1.4 compliance.
* New WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) PrintPreview control in the
  net.sf.paperclips.ui plugin.
* Other existing UI controls (in the net.sf.paperclips.swt package) have been
  moved to the net.sf.paperclips.ui, into the net.sf.paperclips.ui package.
* The PrintUtil class has been replaced with the PaperClips and PrintJob
  classes.
* The new PrintJob class holds information about the job name, document, page
  margins, and paper orientation.
* The new PaperClips class provides a simpler API for printing documents.
* The new Margins class provides fine control over margins on each edge of the
  paper.
* Deprecated package net.sf.paperclips.preview has been removed.

Version 0.5.4
* Bugfix: GridPrint fails to generate last page if the final row of content
  finishes on previous page, but there was only enough room to print an open
  bottom border.  (This bug was discovered while trying to run Snippet4)
* Added SimplePageDecoration, a simple wrapper for static page headers and
  footers.  This class can be used in lieu of creating a custom PageDecoration
  class for simple page numbering.
* The DefaultPageNumberFormat class (the default PageNumberFormat class used
  by PageNumberPrint) is now a top-level, public class.
* Added SimplePageDecoration class, a PageDecoration which displays a Print you
  provide on each page.

Version 0.5.3
* TextPrint - partially reversed a change in 0.5.2 which made TextPrints
  horizontally greedy.  Being horizontally greedy is appropriate for center-
  and right-alignment, but not for left-alignment (the default).

Version 0.5.2
* CellBackgroundProvider interface - an interface for programmatic control of
  the background color in each grid cell.  Default implementation is provided
  in the DefaultBackgroundProvider class.
* DefaultGridLook - now supports control of the header, body, and footer
  background colors using either setHeaderBackground(RGB) or
  setHeaderBackgroundProvider(CellBackgroundProvider).
* Prints with greedy layout behavior now have documentation indicating the
  behavior in the javadocs.
* Bugfix to GridPrint which sometimes cause grids to overlap with other
  prints.

Version 0.5.1
* GridPrint - fixed bug which caused a NullPointerException whenever the cells
  in a row are not all consumed (completely displayed) on the same page.
* Added net.sf.paperclips.decorator package to list of exported packages in
  plugin.

Version 0.5.0
* ScalePrint - wrapper that scales a print down to fit on the page, or scales
  larger or smaller depending on a scaling factor.  Requires SWT 3.2M3 or
  later.
* RotatePrint - wrapper that rotates the target by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
  Since SWT doesn't provide API for setting the page orientation, this will be
  very useful for landscape layouts.  Requires SWT 3.2M3 or later.
* BackgroundPrint - wrapper that draws a background color behind it's target.
* BigPrint - wrapper that splits it's target across multiple pages if it's too
  large to fit on one.  Use this if you have a document that's too big to
  print (i.e. a GridPrint with too many columns).
* Decorator package (net.sf.paperclips.decorator) allows you to create
  decorator factories which can apply decorations to prints without explicitly
  calling the decorator print's constructor.  Provided you use the decorator
  uniformly throughout your document, the style of the document can be changed
  by substituting another decorator.
* TextPrint default font is the system default font instead of hard-coded
  "Times" font.
* Updated semantics of PrintPiece.dispose() to allow PrintPiece and
  BorderPainter re-use.  Anybody who writes their own Print classes should
  check out the javadocs for this method and update their code to comply with
  the new semantics.
* GridPrint got a massive overhaul:
  * Can now add headers and footers that repeat on every page through the
    addHeader(...) and addFooter(...) methods (they work just like the
    add(...) methods).
  * Configure the appearance of your GridPrint using the GridLook interface.
    A default look, DefaultGridLook, lets you configure the cell spacing, cell
    border, and background color of grid cells (separate color for header,
    body, and footer cells).
  * Public fields horizontalSpacing and verticalSpacing were deprecated.
  * Fixed bug 1480013: illogical layout of grid rows when they are broken
    across pages.  Sometimes some content would be on the end of one page and
    the other content would be at the beginning of the next page.  This led to
    sometimes confusing printouts.  This fix essentially "glues" the row
    together so it doesn't get separated like this any more.

Version 0.4.3
* Bugfix: Whenever the print space available to a GridPrint was smaller than
  it's calculated minimum size, the grid would print larger than the available
  space, in certain cases. 

Version 0.4.2
* NoBreakPrint is a wrapper which prevents it's target print from being broken
  up between pages (or columns). 
* BreakPrint adds a page break or column break. 
* PaperClips sources are now version controlled through Subversion (finally!).

Version 0.4.1
* Bugfix: if a GridPrint is configured with a cell border and added to a
  ColumnPrint, an infinite loop will occur when attempting to print. 

Version 0.4.0
* All public API are documented in javadocs. 
* Custom cell borders in GridPrint - uses the same Border interface as
  BorderPrint.

Version 0.3 beta
* AlignPrint - vertical and horizontal alignment of a child print.
* ColumnPrint - lays out a child print into multiple columns.
* GapBorder - a blank border with configurable margin size (see API docs for
  BorderPrint)

Version 0.2 alpha
* PagePrint - page headers and footers (including page numbering)
* BorderPrint - decorating document elements with borders.
* LayerPrint - a layout element which renders document elements one above the
  other.

Version 0.1 alpha
Basic document elements:
* TextPrint - for printing text
* ImagePrint - for printing images
* LinePrint - for printing horizontal and (sometimes) vertical rules.
* GridPrint - arranges it's child prints into a grid.
* LayerPrint - displays it's child prints on top of eachother.
* SeriesPrint - displays multiple prints, one after another, with only one to
  a page.
* FactoryPrint - aids in composition of Prints.
